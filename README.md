# kalavampara_theatre
A Python and MySQL–based theatre seat booking system with a user-friendly GUI for real-time seat selection, pricing, and booking management along with an admin interface.


Kalavampura Theater is a Python-based desktop application that simulates a real-world movie theatre seat booking system. The project provides an interactive graphical interface where users can view seat availability, select seats visually, calculate ticket prices automatically, and confirm bookings with database support.

The application is built using Python (Tkinter) for the GUI and MySQL for backend data storage. Seats are displayed in a theatre-style layout with color coding—green for available seats, red for selected seats, and grey for already booked seats—making the booking process intuitive and user-friendly.

Once booking is completed, seat details and pricing information can be stored securely in the database, ensuring that previously booked seats remain unavailable for future users. The project demonstrates practical usage of GUI programming, database connectivity, event handling, and file management concepts.
